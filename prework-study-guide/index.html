        <li>A 'variable' is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>An 'array' is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <ul>
             <li>Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.
             <li>Array index is the location of an item in an array.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>A 'loop' is used to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false.</li>
          <ul>
             <li>A 'for loop' uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
             <li>A loop will continue running until the defined condition or 'conditional statement' returns false.</li>
             <li>A 'conditional statement' is used for checking a specific condition and executing the code based on the specified condition.</li>
